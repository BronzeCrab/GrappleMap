- multiple viewports
- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- documentation
- joint rotation limits
- prevent joints moving through eachother (maybe, might be more annoying than useful)
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- recognize reorientations with swapped players
- oculus rift support
- generate random walks
- use opengl es so we can use emscripten and webgl without emulation
- debug build
