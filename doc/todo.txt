- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- documentation
- joint rotation limits
- prevent joints moving through eachother (maybe, might be more annoying than useful)
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- oculus rift support
- use opengl es so we can use emscripten and webgl without emulation
- debug build
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- SDL 2.1 (should have emscripten support, see https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=SDL2-Next-Version-Features )
- only regenerate gifs/pngs if necessary
