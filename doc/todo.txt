editor
- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- prevent joints moving through eachother (maybe, might be more annoying than useful)
- joint rotation limits
- vr headset support
- diagnose ice skating
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- editing selected joints as a group
- editing joints while the reorientation is mirrored is broken
- make {pre,post}fix length for demo mode configurable

browseable pages:
- find a better tool/library for generating gifs (need more speed and compression) (Magick++ seems worth a try even though it's also ImageMagick..)
- maybe embed videos encoded with e.g. x264?
- nice urls for position pages
- submission indicators
- investigate graphviz alternatives
- take tagged transitions into account in neighbourhood graphs on tag pages
- make randomly generated scripts use bidirectional transitions in both directions
- figure out better colors
- in the graphs, it would be good to be able to tell really long and really short transitions apart

new tools:
- diff, to visualize changes made to transitions

drill composer
- full screen
- speed dial
- fps and other metrics display
- toggle information about transitions
- clean up code
- leave animation undisturbed when manipulating drill
- integrated transition editor
