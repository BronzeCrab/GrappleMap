editor
- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- vr headset support
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- editing selected joints as a group
- add diagnostics for transitions or transition sequences that:
  * don't respect inertia
  * ice skate
  * rotate joints in unnatural ways
  * move limbs through eachother
- maybe visually indicate where a body's structural mechanics are weak, which directions it could be off-balanced, etc

playback:
- make {pre,post}fix length for demo mode configurable
- experiment with alternative ways to smooth animation, e.g. bezier curves. this should especially
  reduce the corner cutting of the current drag-based smoothing

position pages:
- find a better tool/library for generating gifs (need more speed and compression) (Magick++ seems worth a try even though it's also ImageMagick..)
- maybe embed videos encoded with e.g. x264?
- nice urls for position pages
- submission indicators
- investigate graphviz alternatives
- figure out better colors
- in the graphs, it would be good to be able to tell really long and really short transitions apart
- make scene lighting more like in composer

search page:
- re-use diagram page code
- show tagged transitions
- also search by name/reference substring

explorer:
- find a way to get mouse events through to babylon, or at least mention that arrow keys rotate camera
- clickable position links?
- make sure selected node doesn't get lost when neighbours are unselected or killed
- make camera track players vertically and horizontally
- when turning off edit mode, transition to selected node if necessary
- only load biggest cluster when search page produces disconnected graph
- computing force seems to take way too long
- when aborting a transition, don't play it through, but immediately start rewinding the elapsed part
- in edit mode, auto-kill distant nodes, so that you can keep exploring just by opening nodes
- find solution for multiple transitions between pair of nodes
- info display /without/ framerate hickups
- make zooming with scrollwheel work

drill composer
- speed dial
- fps and other metrics display
- leave animation undisturbed when manipulating drill
- integrated transition editor
- don't fuck up position when window becomes invisible
- first person camera jerky when sliding
- fix aspect ratio when toggling info
- better layout for info checkbox and explorer link

new tools:
- diff, to visualize changes made to transitions

misc:
- mobile-friendly versions of things
- clean up code
