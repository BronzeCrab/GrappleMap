gui
- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- use opengl es so we can use emscripten and webgl without emulation
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- SDL 2.1 (should have emscripten support, see https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=SDL2-Next-Version-Features )
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- prevent joints moving through eachother (maybe, might be more annoying than useful)
- joint rotation limits
- oculus rift support
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- editing selected joints as a group
- editing joints while the reorientation is mirrored goes wrong

browseable pages:
- find a better tool/library for generating gifs (need more speed and compression)
- maybe embed videos encoded with e.g. x264?
- nice urls for position pages
- submission indicators
- investigate graphviz alternatives
- take tagged transitions into account in neighbourhood graphs on tag pages
- show bidirectional transitions with a bidirectional arrow
- make randomly generated scripts use bidirectional transitions in both directions
- figure out better colors
- in the graphs, it would be good to be able to tell really long and really short transitions apart

new tools:
- diff, to visualize changes made to transitions
