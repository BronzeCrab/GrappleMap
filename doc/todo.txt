db
- cage/fence

editor
- in edit mode, auto-hide limbs that obstruct the edited joint
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- vr headset support
- editing selected joints as a group
- add diagnostics for transitions or transition sequences that:
  * don't respect inertia
  * ice skate or hover
  * rotate joints in unnatural ways
  * move limbs through eachother
- maybe visually indicate where a body's structural mechanics are weak, which directions it could be off-balanced, etc
- make "last trans" the default for gui

playback:
- make {pre,post}fix length for demo mode configurable
- experiment with alternative ways to smooth animation, e.g. bezier curves. this should especially
  reduce the corner cutting of the current drag-based smoothing

position pages:
- find a better tool/library for generating gifs (need more speed and compression) (Magick++ seems worth a try even though it's also ImageMagick..)
- maybe embed videos encoded with e.g. x264?
- nice urls for position pages
- submission indicators
- investigate graphviz alternatives
- figure out better colors
- in the graphs, it would be good to be able to tell really long and really short transitions apart
- make scene lighting more like in composer

search page:
- also search by name/reference substring
- only warp if node is unreachable

explorer:
- find a way to get mouse events through to babylon, or at least mention that arrow keys rotate camera
- clickable position links?
- make sure selected node doesn't get lost when neighbours are unselected or killed
- when turning off edit mode, transition to selected node if necessary
- only load biggest cluster when search page produces disconnected graph
- in edit mode, auto-kill distant nodes, so that you can keep exploring just by opening nodes
- find solution for multiple transitions between pair of nodes
- info display /without/ framerate hickups
- make zooming with scrollwheel work
- if nodes form a chain, make composer link load it as a drill
- show bidirectional transitions with bidirectional arrows

drill composer
- speed dial
- fps and other metrics display
- leave animation undisturbed when manipulating drill
- integrated transition editor
- don't fuck up position when window becomes invisible
- first person camera jerky when sliding
- fix aspect ratio when toggling info
- better layout for info checkbox and explorer link

new tools:
- diff, to visualize changes made to transitions

misc:
- mobile-friendly versions of things
- clean up code (a lot)
- get webserver to compress transitions (saves 70%)
