gui
- in edit mode, make it possible to temporarily hide a player, to unobstruct the view to the other
- use opengl es so we can use emscripten and webgl without emulation
- make rotation commands rotate around center between players, not area center
- SDL 2.1 (should have emscripten support, see https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=SDL2-Next-Version-Features )
- experiment with different joint editing schemes, e.g. direct joint coordinate component manipulation
- prevent joints moving through eachother (maybe, might be more annoying than useful)
- joint rotation limits
- oculus rift support
- sticky floor
- direction signs ("to truck", "zombie")
- editing selected joints as a group
- editing joints while the reorientation is mirrored goes wrong

browseable pages:
- find a faster tool/library for generating gifs
- maybe embed videos encoded with e.g. x264?
- reorient positions on tag page to make them as similar as possible
- rotation for tag pages
- nice urls for position pages
- submission indicators in browsable pages
- investigate graphviz alternatives
- take tagged transitions into account in neighbourhood graphs on tag pages

new tools:
- diff, to visualize changes made to transitions
