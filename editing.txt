Guidelines:

	Divide & conquer: first define the few key positions along the sequence where you have a clear idea of what all the details ought to look like,
	then see where the interpolation gives a silly result, e.g. limbs moving through eachother, and add one or more positions in between.

	Don't make many small segments, because it makes making significant adjustments later much harder. Let the interpolation do its work.
	Make sure there's always at least one big-ish movement going on, because remember: in view mode, small movements are not shown as draggable.

	Stay clear from orthogonality. Keep the jiu jitsu tight, so that you don't have limbs flailing around independently.
